### Introduction
The script `run_analysis.R` performs the five steps required in the Course Project of *Getting and Cleaning Data*.

### Data Source
The data sets were downloaded as a zipped file from `https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip`.

### Script Description
The `run_analysis.R` scipt follows the instructions as per the course project, namely:

* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
* From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

**These steps were clearly commented in the R script**. Please also refer to the `CodeBook.md` for the general description of the data processing and the resultant list of variables.
